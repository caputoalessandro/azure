# Azure

This project aims to learn how to use basic Azure features.

in the db.py file there are useful functions to create a table of the Microsoft SQL db mounted on Azure, connect to the database and insert elements.

The azure http trigger function was used in the function_app.py file. in this case the trigger returns some elements of the DB.
